If not, I would encourage you to. They are planning to have a book discussion on February 22nd if you want to join. In the meantime, I wanted to share one principle I learned from a recent reading of this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a story about a woman named Rhonda who came from a background where no one had gone on to college in her family. However, she went on to earn a PhD in mathematics and, after seventy-nine of her eighty applications for a faculty position were rejected, she took a job at the single university that mader her an offer. She contacted the author of GRIT, Angela Duckworth, to discuss an issue she had with an item on her Grit Scale. 'I don't like the item that says, &quot;Setbacks don't discourage me.' That makes no sense. I mean, who doesn't get discouraged by setbacks? I certainly do. I think it should say, 'Setbacks don't discourage me&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;for long&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;I get back on my feet.'&quot;&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela agreed with Rhonda and changed the scale item accordingly, but also made this comment in her book, &quot;the most important thing about Rhonda's story is that she almost never got back up all by herself. Instead, she figured out that asking for help was a good way to &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;hold on to hope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&quot; Rhonda concluded with this insight, &quot;There have been so many times in my career when I wanted to pack it in, when I wanted to give up and do something easier. But there was always someone who, in one way or another, told me to keep going. I think everyone needs somebody like that. Don't you?&quot; [bold and italics added] (pp. 193-195, GRIT).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/ri-Cl1t8S0gz6ZsXapRgUezFzLSWxYEvTiD7G8lS3RAchC8*X-L0qLamP2KrdUjSbYv1KdIod5FIK1Lt2YJbBWDzfn0vUui5/jesuswalkingonwater129516tablet.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;align-left&quot; src=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/ri-Cl1t8S0gz6ZsXapRgUezFzLSWxYEvTiD7G8lS3RAchC8*X-L0qLamP2KrdUjSbYv1KdIod5FIK1Lt2YJbBWDzfn0vUui5/jesuswalkingonwater129516tablet.jpg?width=350&quot; width=&quot;350&quot;  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This story touched me and I thought of us instructors interacting with students. I thought of TGLs and their teaching groups. We are all human and we get knocked down by life. We get discouraged. But I believe the lesson that is to be learned here is to learn to ask for help &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; to open ourselves up to help others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As instructors, we can be reaching out to our struggling students and offering a helping hand. I have had many positive experiences where the student I reached out to personally would respond and express feelings of helplessness and frustration they were experiencing. Together, we were able to get them back on track. At times, I have needed help myself and I didn't know how to overcome the problem on my own. Turning to my leaders and colleagues with my issues provided me with a path that I could follow to achieve success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, let us not forget that we can find help in our Savior Jesus Christ as well. When Nephi lamented &quot;why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow...because of mine afflictions?&quot; he recognized that there was a source to turn to for help. Even though he felt discouraged and had faced setbacks, he had a source he could turn to and his soul could leave the valley of sorrow behind. [2 Nephi 4:26]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would invite you now to share your own stories of how others helped you or when you were able to be a help to others while teaching here at BYU-Idaho.&lt;/strong&gt; I realize there will probably be many who will share stories on the former topic, rather than the latter, but I hope you will recognize those times you were able to be a blessing in the life of someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would also invite you to join the book group reading GRIT by going to this &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://onlineinstruction.ning.com/teaching-groups/grit-study&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;community page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; There are some great discussions starting up here and we hope you can be a part of it.&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the instructors I work with would like to submit an advising referral for a struggling student. (There was a training on this a couple of years ago.) However, we're encountering a couple of problems: the 866 number she originally had is not working. When I referred her to the Support Center (208-496-1411), she was told that they don't do that there, only tech stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried to go back to the original training here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlineinstruction.ning.com/working-with-students/helping-your-struggling-students-student-advising&quot;&gt;https://onlineinstruction.ning.com/working-with-students/helping-your-struggling-students-student-advising&lt;/a&gt; to see if we were missing something, but the link to that training also appears not to be working for me (it says &quot;access denied&quot; or that the resource may be missing.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two questions then: is it still possible for an instructor to submit an advising referral when we worry that a struggling student needs more support? If so, what is the best number to us to make that referral?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

            <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Have you ever been mystified why some students comment that no one is responding to their emails or questions?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;There are three primary places that we often see unanswered student questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Email:&lt;/strong&gt; You may religiously check your email for student emails, but have you ever &lt;a href=&quot;https://byu-idaho.screenstepslive.com/s/14177/m/55347/l/760017-how-to-find-hidden-emails-in-outlook-focused-inbox&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;checked the junk folder&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Instant Messages:&lt;/strong&gt; Look for the red dot on the envelope icon. Never heard of this? &lt;a href=&quot;https://byui.brightspace.com/d2l/le/content/32156/viewContent/1811375/View&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Check here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Questions &amp;amp; Conversations Discussion Board:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure to respond to the questions posted in the discussion board. If you are going to send an email to the student, say that in the discussion board. Unanswered questions give other students the impression that the question is being ignored.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Tips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Set expectations in your course-wide communication for when and how often you will answer student questions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Students should receive an answer to their emails within 24 hours (weekends can be an exception).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Remember that while you may have answered a question several times, it is (often) the first time for the student. Be empathetic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;Answering questions is a great opportunity to develop a good relationship with students. Be encouraging!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I will start by saying this is not an institutionally sanctioned program and more study needs to be placed before academic acceptance takes place. Notwithstanding this, I share the latest success with this experiment with the hope that certain realizations may take place. Let me start in the beginning, I have three children that have learning differences and who had IEP s during their elementary and high school years. As a parent, I was frustrated because I did not think that there was enough analysis to identify how learners could have successful experiences without being labeled with the typical labels others, who don't understand, exact on the student. My experience was that I had an Auditory learner, a physical or manipulative learner, and a dyslectic. While there learning styles were different, they should have been given equal opportunity and I felt like that was missing. Fortunately, they have found their respective vibes and are doing well in their adult years. This experience has created a heightened sense of awareness when student struggle in the classroom. This is the reason for the development ofÂ the &lt;strong&gt;StudentÂ Development Matrix.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The matrix addresses four areas including Learning Style, Personality Color, Social Style, and Role Identification. Each area addresses important elements of the student learning cycle by identifying the type of learner, the orientation of the student from analytical to expressive and points in between along with their social quotient and psychological compass in terms of being supportive, action-driven, developmental or impactful. Each area is identified and entered into the respective quadrant. The outcome provides a direction for the student and offers fields of study that support a professional direction. This, in turn, offers greater purpose and higher retention. The evidence is anecdotal and needs more formal study but let me offer this as a form of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent student was trying to determine a specific field of study. We had several sessions wherein we spoke of the elements of the learning matrix and over the course of the semester. We determined the results of the four quadrants. The resultÂ of the Student Development matrix was: Verbal Learner, Red personality, an Analytical/Amiable Social Quotient, and Impact psychology. The student was pointed toward a Certified Financial Planning career as one of the possibilities. The student has a renewed purpose in learning, is motivated and falls in a high retention category for student success.This is what the Results Matrix looked like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/P*wUccwtk8t0cPA5wqbiTXxEF56qMRxhC*YllnCBbLigVFM2StpD9EiqJ*VGzDrSB1I0Dy0eOzao2w*OLid*XRRn*Q74AGmT/ScreenShot20180123at7.33.50PM.png&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;align-full&quot; src=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/P*wUccwtk8t0cPA5wqbiTXxEF56qMRxhC*YllnCBbLigVFM2StpD9EiqJ*VGzDrSB1I0Dy0eOzao2w*OLid*XRRn*Q74AGmT/ScreenShot20180123at7.33.50PM.png&quot; width=&quot;395&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

            <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a bad experience with a plagiarism case late in the semester last semester, and it has made me want to make sure I'm very wide open with this early in the semester this go around. So I did a quick search and found this interesting article that I thought I'd use parts of this week as I train my students on my expectations in this area.

            <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I've got a question about one of my students. It is apparent in the assignments they have submitted so far that English isn't their first language, and there are some major grammatical concepts missing. I teach a writing course, so a solid understanding of English is very important. I worry about this student's ability to succeed in the class because these fundamental pieces are missing.Â &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The course syllabus says this: &quot;No official prerequisites. This class is meant for freshman-level students. COMM 100 should be concurrently enrolled, at least. To be successful, you will need basic English grammar, knowledge of how to use a dictionary and keyboarding skills.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Have you ever had a student you felt wasn't quite qualified for the course? How would you deal with this? Right now, I am grading this student the same as other students (which I think it appropriate) and offering as much guidance as possible, but I question the student's ability to succeed in the course.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What would you do?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

            <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Everyone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I teach GS120L and I am going to be getting my course set up here.Â  One thing that I have been doing manually is fixing the end dates so they are a week later.Â  Then I manually go in and deduct 10% per day that the assignment is late.Â  So up to a week or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My concern is how to reduce grades for quizzes-- the system does not automatically indicate that an assignment is late, so I have had to go in manually and figure out how late it is, what % to take off, and what the grade should be.Â  This can be very tedious and time consuming.Â  (Does anyone have an easier way to do this??)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My question is to you all:Â  &lt;span class=&quot;font-size-5&quot;&gt;How many days do you allow late assignments?Â Â &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last semester, another instructor indicated that they only allowed assignments open for late submissions for 3 days.Â  That would definitely speed things up for me and make it easier.Â  But what do you all do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as I remember, it is up to us as the instructors to determine our own Late Work Policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much!

            <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;h1 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We have reached the middle of the semester, typically a time for midterm tests and papers coming due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;This can be a time of fear, anxiety, and panic from students. When students are put under a great deal of pressure and feel they have no chance for success, it can push them to be more likely to cheat in some form or another. It is at these critical times that online instructors can step in and provide some encouragement and reinforcement to help students maintain their academic integrity. So next time you are crafting an announcement or writing a class-wide email, keep some of these questions in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JyxC9LIKXHGkj4_ZbFKx45ynpYrHQrtmG2-_dsuAumH4cW5LmA4BfhQgmW7rvPud0Z_fE6RBkRCGGOniMRze8ilcH7G0aSL6JBmj_iiQwj_GFVQImw3Nuo9aTElrXP9AtwezFwix&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;align-right&quot; src=&quot;https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/JyxC9LIKXHGkj4_ZbFKx45ynpYrHQrtmG2-_dsuAumH4cW5LmA4BfhQgmW7rvPud0Z_fE6RBkRCGGOniMRze8ilcH7G0aSL6JBmj_iiQwj_GFVQImw3Nuo9aTElrXP9AtwezFwix?width=317&quot; width=&quot;317&quot;  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-4&quot;&gt;Is there a big test or paper due in the next couple of weeks?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Make sure you publicize it strongly and highlight how students can be successful. Sometimes suggesting smaller steps they can complete at that moment can help students know how to pace themselves so they feel like they can be successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;For example: â€œMake sure that by Friday you have at least completed your introduction of the outline you made. Make sure you have a strong thesis statement and present the opposing viewpoint in your introduction and explain why your view is preferred.â€&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-4&quot;&gt;Did you mention the honor code before?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Whether you did or not, now is a good time to reinforce it in one of your announcements or emails to the class. If you are aware of common issues students have made in your class in the past, be sure to address those to help your students understand just what constitutes cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;For example: Class, I havenâ€™t mentioned this before in my announcement but it is something I know we are all familiar with: the honor code. As students of this institution, you have committed to be honest and not cheat on your homework. I know the temptation can be strong for that, especially with an upcoming paper due.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-4&quot;&gt;Do your students know you care about whether they cheat or not?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If students donâ€™t feel that you care, they will care less themselves. You can be a warning voice and an encouraging one at the same time. Consider this: Would it be better to help a student avoid cheating and all the consequences that can come with it or would it be better to have to have tougher conversations after cheating has occurred and try to explain to the student what they did wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;For example: â€œClass, As we approach a large test, I know the stress you are feeling and, for some, the temptation there can be. I wanted to encourage you to review the material from Lessons 3 to 6 to be prepared. Remember, the honor code and your commitment to maintain your integrity. Donâ€™t give in to the enticement to get a good grade by disreputable means. I am here if you have any questions and I am holding a 1-hour live review session this Thursday for anyone who comes with questions. I can post a recording of our review session later.â€&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-5&quot;&gt;Further Resources:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We have a great 3-page PDF that provides more details and suggestions for how online instructors can help reduce cheating in their online courses: &lt;a href=&quot;http://byu-idaho.screenstepslive.com/s/17057/a/702079-academic-integrity&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;http://byu-idaho.screenstepslive.com/s/17057/a/702079-academic-integrity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really appreciate the new Disability Services training resources created by Instructor Development. If you haven't seen them yet, check them out here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've found that these tutorials clearly lay out how I can work with the University to help my students have success. I've had a small handful of experiences helping students with disabilities, but I would like to learn from others.&amp;#160;I want to help them be successful, but not give them too much room that it would be easy to potentially take advantage of the situation. I mean that in the most respectful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are &quot;reasonable accommodations&quot; that I can make for students with a disability&amp;#160;that will create the right learning environment, and provide enough motivation and resources to be successful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This semester I had a student who submitted an assignment that she didn't write herself. &amp;#160;It was plainly obvious when I read the assignment so I decided to email the student. &amp;#160;I blind-copied my TGL so she was aware of the situation. &amp;#160;When the situation resolved my TGL asked me to post here as an example of one possible way to address the situation. &amp;#160;In a previous life I worked as a probation officer and, as a result of my experience there, have grown comfortable having direct conversations with people. &amp;#160;What follows is a transcript of my email conversation with my student (student's name is redacted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Initial Email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Name Redacted],&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading your assignment submission for the Application Activity for Lesson 12 and realized it's not your work. &amp;#160;I am very disappointed. &amp;#160;This is cheating and is not appropriate. &amp;#160;I will be giving you a 0% grade on this assignment as a result.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to give you an opportunity to come clean. &amp;#160;I realize that the person who you got this assignment from isn't the original author of the assignment. &amp;#160;I'd like you to make the situation right by answering the following questions:&lt;br /&gt;
Who provided you the assignment? &amp;#160;Who provided that person the assignment? &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be conducting an audit of your past submissions as well to try and determine the extent of the academic dishonesty. &amp;#160;If there is additional work that you submitted for which you are not the original author, this would be an opportune time to let me know. &amp;#160;Because of the lateness in the semester there is little flexibility afforded me to help you re-do assignments. &amp;#160;I will let you know before I take any additional actions.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm saddening by this situation and hope we can find some good of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student's first response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this email finds you well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly I would like to apologize for the dishonesty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a fear of failing due to a very busy schedule and a family crisis at hand, my husband moved to Dubai living me to fend for our 5 children plus my sister, yes I did cheat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am truly embarrassed by it. This was the first time I did this. I was just under stress and I know it is not an excuse at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I acted irrationally and irresponsibly and I am so sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the assignment from the home computer. My sister had done this program and I decided to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so very sorry about this. My heart is really broken by this. I cannot explain to you the shame that I am feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please do find it in your heart to forgive me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Name Redacted]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My response to student's response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Name Redacted],&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your forthright and candid response. I'm sure it was not an easy email to write. &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sorry to hear about your family situation. I hope and pray for a favorable resolution for you all.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I gave you a 0% grade for the assignment the good news is that the overall impact on your final grade is very small.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've had a really good semester, this incident excepting, and I hope you learn from it and put it behind you. I think you'll do great on the final and in whatever pursuit is next on your list.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student's final response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope&amp;#160; this email finds you well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so very much for the lenience towards me. I am truly ashamed of my behavior and it does not display the behavior of a true disciple of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much once again for the nature of understanding that you have shown towards me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May the Lord bless you evermore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind regards&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been reviewing to see if any instructions in our course need to be clarified for students. Â I had a new perspective on the instructions for quizzes and the final exam. Â When I started as instructor then OCR for my course, the instructions said &quot;closed book&quot;. Â Through the semesters I have had this &quot;fixed&quot; several times to clarify what that means. Â On occasions when I have addressed this with students whom I have been concerned have used outside sources, I have had students tell me straightforward what they have used thinking it was okay. Â On a couple of occasions I have had students who told me that all that they used were notes they had written themselves while they studied so that was not cheating. Â Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently our directions say &quot;closed book&quot; then go on to explain that means you can use &quot;only your memory&quot; and list some things you cannot use. It seems a bit cumbersome. Â As I read it last week I thought about when I was in school we used textbooks to study. Â Closed book means something to me. Â In this day of all of the internet and other technical resources (of which it seems my students are often telling me about things that are new to me) I suppose there may be students who never use textbooks. Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the correct way to say something is &quot;closed book&quot;? Â Is it still proper to say &quot;closed book&quot;? Â Can you share how some other courses tell this to students?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

            <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some reason this semester I've seen more plagiarism than I have before... or maybe I just didn't notice it in the past. I'm trying to write an announcement post for next semester to help guide students to know what plagiarism is and how to avoid it. I'd love some suggestions/help in editing it. For context, I teach an anatomy course for &quot;non-majors.&quot; They are frequently overwhelmed with the amount of information, and we ask a lot of &quot;define&quot; and &quot;list&quot; type questions, so I can see how it would be difficult to try to rewrite something in your own words (especially for me ESL folks). Here's my attempt to explain it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the last few semesters, I've finally realized that I need to do a better job of teaching what constitutes plagiarism and not doing your own work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol type=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;li value=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;strong&gt;Define&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; - a lot of our assignments ask you to define or explain a concept. If it is a long definition or explanation, then it is expected that you reword your answer. You need to use your own words even though you are explaining a &quot;textbook&quot; topic. Since it is assumed that you are using the textbook or other assigned resources to find your answers, you don't need to make a &quot;Works Cited&quot; page (for study guides, labs, etc.).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-4&quot;&gt;Hi Everyone. I'm working on a project for a new Pathway Worldwide course and would love to hear your ideas on the subject. One of the course objectives is to help students become Agentive or self-reliant online learners. I'm trying to answer the following questions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-4&quot;&gt;What is the doctrine behind being a successful online learner? (gospel-centered)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-4&quot;&gt;What are the principles online students need to learn and follow to be effective and successful online students?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-4&quot;&gt;What are the traits and habits of successful online students?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-4&quot;&gt;What knowledge and skills do students need to develop in order to become successful online students?&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-4&quot;&gt;We'd like to hear from your knowledge and experiences in your own courses, as well as from your own studies and learning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</content>

            <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been so touched and amazed by a particular student that I have in my GS 120L course this semester. Â He is seriously theÂ &lt;em&gt;bestÂ &lt;/em&gt;student I have ever (and probably will ever) have. Â &lt;strong&gt;Not to mention he is from India.&lt;/strong&gt; Â Here are some examples of why:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sent me this email today (which is incredibly impressive):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hi DaNae,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;How are you? I had a small observation in the quiz in this lesson:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Screenshot FYR&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://outlook.office.com/owa/service.svc/s/GetFileAttachment?id=AAMkADNhOGUxZWE5LTZlNmMtNDA0MS05MDY2LTE2ODUwZjhkMGYzMgBGAAAAAAA8iYZFZSUkSo6MLfhU2XI9BwCtYo%2Fm9soaQIntzm4psE3fAAAAADt0AADyZt75b%2BJhQ4646robeDH9AAMmslUmAAABEgAQAFAYWglLg%2FZMuKx7pdNdDZM%3D&amp;amp;X-OWA-CANARY=R2zQ9pWquEyigK2Shz6bO7B-gZFzsNQYqEA0HsXmuTDxcSPQbyUdprOP-Bo7jJnEI8I0jqjmOwI.&amp;amp;isImagePreview=True&quot; width=&quot;517&quot; height=&quot;147&quot; alt=&quot;Inline image 1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As per the scripture reference - V11 of Chapter 4 of the book Matthew, Angels ministered Jesus after the devil left. However, it is wrong. Because we learned about finding the truth and researching, I felt this question leads the students away from the Truth.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The reason I say this is because there is JST for this particular verse that explains the actual situation and who these angelsÂ were and whom they were ministering. Please find the screenshot FYI.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://outlook.office.com/owa/service.svc/s/GetFileAttachment?id=AAMkADNhOGUxZWE5LTZlNmMtNDA0MS05MDY2LTE2ODUwZjhkMGYzMgBGAAAAAAA8iYZFZSUkSo6MLfhU2XI9BwCtYo%2Fm9soaQIntzm4psE3fAAAAADt0AADyZt75b%2BJhQ4646robeDH9AAMmslUmAAABEgAQALp9evIwT81IrusNA%2FJ0jAM%3D&amp;amp;X-OWA-CANARY=R2zQ9pWquEyigK2Shz6bO7B-gZFzsNQYqEA0HsXmuTDxcSPQbyUdprOP-Bo7jJnEI8I0jqjmOwI.&amp;amp;isImagePreview=True&quot; width=&quot;517&quot; height=&quot;217&quot; alt=&quot;Inline image 2&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I feel this question should be removed or modified in the future semesters as the answer as per the New Testament will lead the students away from the truth. However, if an option is placed that &quot; Angels were sent to John By Jesus and they ministered John.&quot; It might be helpful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is my observation and suggestion only. I thought I will share it with you. I like JST and used several times in correcting the verses that don'tÂ make any sense. Chapter 4 of Matthew has many verses with JST in the footnotes. It can help us understand the scriptures more clearly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warm Regards,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[Student name]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here is another email he sent me earlier this semester:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Hi DaNae,&lt;div&gt;I just saw the message from [another student] on Discussion Board and your comment below. He said, &quot;Someone suggest me what would be an ideal course that will help my profession from BYU-I.&quot; What he was saying is that he neededÂ &lt;b&gt;some suggestions from you or the group members with regards to the courses in BYU-I that can help boost his teaching career.&lt;/b&gt;Â Most of theÂ Indians first frame their sentences in their native tongue (In their Brain) and then convert the same to English. It is a quick process. However, it might give out the wrong meaning or confusion.Â &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I thought I would clarify you this as many Americans I met face similar communication issues when dealing with fewÂ Indians and are confused or sometimes get a different meaning altogether.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[He then inserted a screenshot of the discussion board post he was referring to]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I thought IÂ should help you understand his query.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Warm Regards,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[Student name]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;And one more so you have an idea of how incredible he truly is (if you couldn't tell already):&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ol62RYpl3f8eL*2nfCtEHl0B6fB0OFOhKELs4RSzZBBOZKPMagbmFDYMvkDripddx2WOmO7IiogKEbFPlm*lgYqC1Zk9dGCH/AmazingStudent.png&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/Ol62RYpl3f8eL*2nfCtEHl0B6fB0OFOhKELs4RSzZBBOZKPMagbmFDYMvkDripddx2WOmO7IiogKEbFPlm*lgYqC1Zk9dGCH/AmazingStudent.png&quot; width=&quot;555&quot; class=&quot;align-full&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is not all he has done. Â He has answered multiple students questions (even better responses than I might give), and he is just all around an outstanding student.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What I am wondering is--what can I do to reward/thank him for all he has done? Â My class does not allow extra credit (he does not need it anyway.. he has a very high score), but I would love to do something special to really show my appreciation for what he has done/is doing for me and all the other students.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sorry for the lengthy post. Â &lt;strong&gt;If you are still reading... do you have any good ideas to share with me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;DaNae Barnard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

            <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My SMART goal this semester is to help my struggling students. Â Going after the individual students who struggle one by one, as Jesus taught the importance ofÂ leaving the 99 sheep andÂ going after the one lost sheep. Â &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/jV-siujuUci0loMbNiDIj*AveKk1ByxU7h2GMDyrvJ*mjvezQnZcRmd7oLR7m8cs3xd*4KKX21eVIjgTSCvgEaCXLLv8-D7o/AdobeSpark.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/jV-siujuUci0loMbNiDIj*AveKk1ByxU7h2GMDyrvJ*mjvezQnZcRmd7oLR7m8cs3xd*4KKX21eVIjgTSCvgEaCXLLv8-D7o/AdobeSpark.jpg?width=721&quot; width=&quot;721&quot; class=&quot;align-full&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have been trying to help 3 of my struggling students and have been reaching out to Pathway Support Center and Pathway Advising.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the last 4 years that I have been blessed to work for as a GS 120L Pathway Teacher, I have a good habit of reaching out to Pathway Support Center or Pathway Advising on the phone or by email when I have a struggling students. Â I have noticed with changes in FERPA there seems to be more increased restrictions on how much Pathway Support advisors can help the students or how much information about the students that the advisors can share with me as the students online instructor. Â However, Â after I have done all I can do to help the students, I am concerned about how much time it takes for Pathway Support Center and Pathway Advising to actually help struggling students with the concerns that they are struggling with. The best thing that I have found I can do is follow up multiple times by phone and email!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STUDENT 1.) Â My student reached out to me by I-Learn 3.0 instant message because his name is not showing properly in the course.&lt;/strong&gt;Â Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/SC5tqKJCifh1ZzdZDEOBpIpz5rHvBnNB96Ybzrz*WeIQm3KHaJK-82ywFWfueJZgKsSWvFBMlLtTgUFTY2vyoifQEvTTtfoU/00002259.png&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/SC5tqKJCifh1ZzdZDEOBpIpz5rHvBnNB96Ybzrz*WeIQm3KHaJK-82ywFWfueJZgKsSWvFBMlLtTgUFTY2vyoifQEvTTtfoU/00002259.png?width=400&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;align-full&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I can sense my students frustration that he had to talk to three different people from Pathway Support Center, but none of them could help. Â The student reached back to me for additional support. Â  I reached out to my TGL, who reached out to my AIM. Â Here is their response....in short.... there is nothing we can do to help the students this situation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/SC5tqKJCifiBbCcPwktTKsGZkVc4XtkQdxZ0ogfeYvRJowwEGkotF7QAiztS6e26SMu0Amd-knL6dUFd7Aor7VvlMPgqZ-EG/00002262.png&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/SC5tqKJCifiBbCcPwktTKsGZkVc4XtkQdxZ0ogfeYvRJowwEGkotF7QAiztS6e26SMu0Amd-knL6dUFd7Aor7VvlMPgqZ-EG/00002262.png?width=400&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;align-full&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I even called Pathway Support Center myself and there is nothing that I can do to help my student. Â The advisor said that sometimes the student may have their name wrong in the church records and sometimes the ward clerk can make that change. Â But again it requires a Pathway Advisor calling and talking to this student to help them understand who they can resolve their concern. Â Â Sadly, now 12 days since the student came to me for help, and there is nothing that I can do to help my student.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They sent out an email today....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/-CpnVfDvGiUnw96FaiH5yYgqZeTTlYo5ZjawX91ShZ6o6IRJMYIuZdWuIxlp-bYpf*XR40RZMTQHXGAi4dIBmXbfd6Kb86AD/00002278.png&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/-CpnVfDvGiUnw96FaiH5yYgqZeTTlYo5ZjawX91ShZ6o6IRJMYIuZdWuIxlp-bYpf*XR40RZMTQHXGAi4dIBmXbfd6Kb86AD/00002278.png?width=400&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;align-full&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Pathway Support Center advisor made no mention of the contact the student made personally with them....only my contact the last 12 days. Â Maybe there was not records made in the students file even though the student says they have talked to 3 different advisors? Â What else can be done to help this student?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STUDENT 2.) I have one student whose email address is not working, it always bounces back when I try to send emails.&lt;/strong&gt;Â  This means I have no way to reach out to this student who is struggling and not participating in the course. Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/SC5tqKJCifjBWwBdyrGo1ZfV3Huuv3OQdf710KZpZP-ERBoCU9pgYHFMmhgXnAgPXXxhgCPFZUshwXsac5mgvP72BIc3BULo/00002263.png&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/SC5tqKJCifjBWwBdyrGo1ZfV3Huuv3OQdf710KZpZP-ERBoCU9pgYHFMmhgXnAgPXXxhgCPFZUshwXsac5mgvP72BIc3BULo/00002263.png?width=400&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;align-full&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reached out to Pathway Support Center over a month ago by phone to help me find this students correct email address, but nothing has been done regarding the issue. Â  So I reached out again to the Pathway Support center yesterday. Â After the Pathway Support Center advisor asked me the student's email address, they said would send this student an email to see if they could contact them....also after emailing them this morning a Pathway Support Center advisor sent me this email telling me that they sent the student information....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/JYhfrjzEt0jQ2MqsPBaUgdhNqtc-t3FeZomuuIz-FiF9zMnmWfViyJCK3RkWd4nB7RxBpha-XMlheSpSPWgqGCANh-Z-O2g7/00002281.png&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/JYhfrjzEt0jQ2MqsPBaUgdhNqtc-t3FeZomuuIz-FiF9zMnmWfViyJCK3RkWd4nB7RxBpha-XMlheSpSPWgqGCANh-Z-O2g7/00002281.png?width=400&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;align-full&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that student cannot be reached by email so they will not get this email. Â We don't know if the student wants to keep participating or if they want to withdraw because I haven't been able to contact this student the entire semester because the emails don't work. Â  Could the advisor call the student? Â When I asked on the phone yesterday the advisor asked me for the students phone number, but as a Pathway instructor I am not given this contact information. Â I thought that Pathway Support Center advisors have access to this information and could call the students and they have access to their phone number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually later in the evening I got this email Pathway Support Center said that they were able to contact the student by email and phone, when I couldn't reach the student by email at all....and the student has been withdrawn from the course.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/ZmNrG-6RHE1i4JfNSq-X*yiuGFTRSn9MSysoFnE4cxNZ3Y4hJdPDystZvPv-dRmDVCAwOF4GpThjD7MnoXq6hqf9vafsZSAy/00002285.png&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/ZmNrG-6RHE1i4JfNSq-X*yiuGFTRSn9MSysoFnE4cxNZ3Y4hJdPDystZvPv-dRmDVCAwOF4GpThjD7MnoXq6hqf9vafsZSAy/00002285.png?width=400&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;align-full&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day I received the first email from Pathway Advising confirming the withdraw of this student:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/gqyR5RxHPlFdvdbi-1-kQp3Dda4BKQPSfzzj4AcS1tC09hFDw-TnIwwMauRHDI2N6q6TWrHnz*rLNutgdJ0yoqgqmltm*4hg/20170517_1701.png&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/gqyR5RxHPlFdvdbi-1-kQp3Dda4BKQPSfzzj4AcS1tC09hFDw-TnIwwMauRHDI2N6q6TWrHnz*rLNutgdJ0yoqgqmltm*4hg/20170517_1701.png?width=400&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;align-full&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STUDENT 3.) Â A student reached out to me by email over a month ago to withdraw from the course, Â but has still not been withdrawn from the course yet.&lt;/strong&gt;Â  Â This student is a mother, and she said she doesn't have time to participate in the program, so I forwarded her email to Pathway Support and Pathway Advising Center. Â I received multiple emails from multiple advisors, but to my knowledge no one actually was able to make actual contact with her and teach her what she can do to withdraw. Â I called the Pathway Support Center yesterday to follow up on this students situation and Italked to one advisor, she said that she would try to make contact with her and follow up with me, however later in the afternoon I received an email from a different advisor saying they sent her a tutorial to withdraw. Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/SC5tqKJCifgMN1iftAF1zKvSvhZsdMVIlJ8KI0oBWw73oTui39Qacyw7AdpRVpNNCBvhwmBYnrk0F-5-M3SzgS1oH*7b566M/00002257.png&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/SC5tqKJCifgMN1iftAF1zKvSvhZsdMVIlJ8KI0oBWw73oTui39Qacyw7AdpRVpNNCBvhwmBYnrk0F-5-M3SzgS1oH*7b566M/00002257.png?width=721&quot; width=&quot;481&quot; class=&quot;align-full&quot; height=&quot;239&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I replied to this advisor and asked him if he could call this student....another advisor emailed me today:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/jV-siujuUch0ZSvDVKMZ6ACDHsOTy5AH84JmHZ33F6WDqYKw8MQmY7ogaCQ7vJfHw5ww4xgcWzU3MLiAyc6xryy*-6QDXQiU/00002273.png&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/jV-siujuUch0ZSvDVKMZ6ACDHsOTy5AH84JmHZ33F6WDqYKw8MQmY7ogaCQ7vJfHw5ww4xgcWzU3MLiAyc6xryy*-6QDXQiU/00002273.png?width=500&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; class=&quot;align-full&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Withdraw Tutorial is a PDF file, so I cannot upload it in this discussion board reply.....but the steps areÂ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 1.) Log intoÂ &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; href=&quot;https://pathway.lds.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://pathway.lds.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 2 &amp;amp; 3.) Click sign in and use your username and password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Step 4 -10) Click &quot;Withdrawl&quot; from Pathway, and then they are taken to a Withdraw survey in English to indicate why they are withdrawing and if they have contacted an advisor, technical support, or your instructor, then they have to confirm they are withdrawing one more time before the withdraw process is complete.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/jV-siujuUch1fRmStvXJXWEpbJtfThGDXg844bCWmZ1kcigcIikbpi6SYyJWYs9LF771ALfuIGfxYi55xI6zurUFjRIv0f-I/00002274.png&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com/files/jV-siujuUch1fRmStvXJXWEpbJtfThGDXg844bCWmZ1kcigcIikbpi6SYyJWYs9LF771ALfuIGfxYi55xI6zurUFjRIv0f-I/00002274.png?width=400&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; class=&quot;align-full&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My student most likely has difficulty understanding English - Â even though the advisor may have thought they were being helpful in sending the student the tutorial. Â Maybe simplified instructions is needed? Maybe advisors can reach out to the student in their native language to make sure this students issues are not left unresolved? Other challenges is that with international students they may provide a phone number but it may not be at their home because they might not even have a home phone or cell phone.Â &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After contacting Pathway Support multiple times over a month, only one situation with my struggling student has been resolved. Â How can we help our other struggling students resolve their concerns quicker and make sure they don't fall through the cracks? It seems to me that it would be helpful to continue to refine and streamline the Pathway Support Center or Pathway Advising to exploreÂ possibilities of how to moreÂ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;b&gt;effectively help our Pathway International Students and the online instructors who support them. Here are some of my personal suggestions and observations:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be helpful to have one advisor be assigned a struggling student and follow through with this individual student instead of multiple advisors working on the same students situation.Â It would be also be great for advisors to contact the online instructor who has called in with the concern, to update on progress - especially if it was the online instructor who contacted Pathway Support Center or Pathway Advising to discuss the situation the student is struggling with.Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even though there are issues with time zones, it seems like it would be helpful to have advisors with language skills reach out to our Pathway students on the phone.Â I am not sure some advisors realize how to help the international students with an issue with comprehension and understanding of the English language when they send them emails. Â Or maybe even send emails in their native language.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Â It would be wonderful if their concerns are resolved within 24 hours or 7 days --in a quick loving way to help them keep progressing toward their educational goals that will improve the quality of their lives -- instead of having the students wait for a few weeks or even a few months. Â After all, it is these struggling students who are not participating in the Pathway Program could be the students who could benefit the most from the Pathway Program.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be helpful for Pathway Support Center to create a graphic that shows the students issues and how they can resolve them. Â For example have a simplified version of what withdraw instructions in multiple languages. Â It would be helpful to make this graphic available so that online instructors clear communications on what online instructors can do or even what advisors can do to help.Â &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would also be helpful to have students native language available to Pathway online instructors on the students profile....also it would be great to have the students international phone number available to online instructors without having to request that they receive this information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maybe requiring an alternative contact phone number for someone who can contact the student when the students are registering if they do not have a phone? Â This will give Pathway Support Center and online instructors an alternative way to contact the student by phone?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please feel free to share your feedback or enlighten me in strategies to help struggling GS 120L Pathway students. Â Also how can Pathway Instructors more effectively coordinate with Pathway Support Center and Pathway Advising to help and love our struggling international students!Â &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

            <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://us.123rf.com/450wm/asturianu/asturianu1503/asturianu150300165/38703054-illustration-with-word-cloud-on-disease-autism.jpg?ver=6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://us.123rf.com/450wm/asturianu/asturianu1503/asturianu150300165/38703054-illustration-with-word-cloud-on-disease-autism.jpg?ver=6&amp;amp;width=300&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; class=&quot;align-full&quot;  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How many times has this been you as an instructor:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A student tells you they have a learning disability. They want to know what you can do to help them, but you aren't sure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A parent contacts you to inform you that their child in your class has a learning disability and would like to help them every step of the way in college.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You suspect that one of your students has a learning disability, but you aren't sure how to approach a conversation with the student, asking if they have ever been diagnosed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Online Learning at BYU-Idaho and BYU-Pathway Worldwide continues to spread all over the world, there will naturally follow a pool of students with an increasingly diverse spectrum of learning disorders and disabilities. We are seeing this increase right now as we often get questions from instructors on what to do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to your questions about how to help a student with disabilities, we invited the director of the Disability Services Office at BYU-Idaho, &lt;strong&gt;Wade Gordon,&lt;/strong&gt; and his associate, &lt;strong&gt;Nate Reese,&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;to participate in our first Live Q&amp;amp;A event. Instructors got the chance to ask Wade and Nate these questions and many, many more about how an instructor can best accommodate a student with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below this video is a list of questions that were asked during the event. If you click on the link immediately following the question, you will jump to the place in the video where that question is addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cSUcyZqGCws&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the main processes for how an online student with disabilities interacts with an instructor and the Disabilities Service office?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=3m35s&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=3m35s&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCNuruajU6NMCFQ_ifgodPKsN-Cj4HQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What kinds of questions would be good if you need to find out a studentâ€™s disability without asking too directly?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=7m47s&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=7m47s&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCNuruajU6NMCFQ_ifgodPKsN-Cj4HQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If my course has a required on-mic weekly meeting but my student says they cannot be on-mic, would it be appropriate to give them full credit for participating via chat, is that making an accommodation, or should I still dock some points as I would with any other student?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=16m28s&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=16m28s&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCNuruajU6NMCFQ_ifgodPKsN-Cj4HQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we address a possible learning disability like a reading disorder if thereâ€™s no information from the department office or from the student?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=19m49s&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=19m49s&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCNuruajU6NMCFQ_ifgodPKsN-Cj4HQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a student with anxiety and depression who asks for accommodations. Is anxiety and depression considered a disability? And what kinds of things can I do to accommodate them?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=21m45s&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=21m45s&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCNuruajU6NMCFQ_ifgodPKsN-Cj4HQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if you suspect a student has disability but itâ€™s never been diagnosed? How do you recommend a teacher handles that situation?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=28m35s&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=28m35s&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCNuruajU6NMCFQ_ifgodPKsN-Cj4HQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the most helpful resources available for students with dyslexia? Do you track data on what types of disabilities seem to struggle the most in school, and what accommodations can be made to best help those students?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=33m48s&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=33m48s&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCNuruajU6NMCFQ_ifgodPKsN-Cj4HQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have any tips or tricks for mentoring students that are struggling with class work due to a disorder?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=40m4s&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=40m4s&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCNuruajU6NMCFQ_ifgodPKsN-Cj4HQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about students that have temporary situations like family death, health issues etc?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=43m2s&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=43m2s&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCNuruajU6NMCFQ_ifgodPKsN-Cj4HQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What about parents that do too much for their child, including contacting the instructor weekly about their childâ€™s progress?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=44m3s&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=44m3s&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCNuruajU6NMCFQ_ifgodPKsN-Cj4HQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A student finally got a form from the Disabilities office and submitted it around week five, what is a teacherâ€™s obligation as far as weeks 1-4, sort of retroactively accommodating the student?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=47m22s&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=47m22s&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCNuruajU6NMCFQ_ifgodPKsN-Cj4HQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many instructors use different kinds of visual displays that some students have difficulty viewing (ie: different color fonts and students with color blindness), how can instructors make their courses more friendly and accessible for these kinds of students?&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=51m20s&quot; class=&quot;yt-uix-sessionlink&quot; data-url=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcyZqGCws#t=51m20s&quot; data-sessionlink=&quot;itct=CDIQ6TgYACITCNuruajU6NMCFQ_ifgodPKsN-Cj4HQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSUcy...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello! I have a student who has reached out to me and asked if there is a way she can attend the gathering two times a month and then Skype in for the other two. She has to drive one hour and 40 minutes each way to attend. She has a job and is a single mom as well. I'd like to help her out if we can. Anyone know if this is an option? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it is because our ward has begun talking about the youth trek coming up this summer, or maybe it is all the snow we've been getting in Rexburg, but when I think of pushing through difficult trials my mind turns towards the pioneers and this painting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many perspectives depicted in the painting, and so many comparisons we can imagine for ourselves and our students. Are we the angels, helping push the handcarts? Perhaps the older sibling pulling the younger sibling along in the snow? Regardless of where you see yourself, everyone is working towards a common goal and helping push one another along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we've been trekking through this semester for a number of weeks. You and your students are tired. You've just come to a big hill: the mid-semester slump. This is the point where many may begin to give up and lose hope. This is where having you, our online instructors, is critical, and no amount of course design can replace you. How can you help your students overcome that mid-semester slump? To continue to push on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've provided a few suggestions in the video below, but we'd love to hear your &quot;pioneer trek&quot; stories, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What challenges do you and your students face as the semester begins to drag? How were those challenges overcome?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Did you ever consider the possibility that your greatest influence as in instructor may be with the lost sheep who are not participating in your class? Some students quit participating in an online class toward the middle or even the end of the semester if they are feeling overwhelmed and that they can't endure to the end. Some never get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As instructors, we can send a powerful message that we care for these students as we encourage them to return and finish the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;So, how do we find these lost sheep?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/7gjKKn4oGHRhsvrv9PxgyE5kgdzd47rfUvnXWOhN8sNiAqlWdfY*alJ2SCM6QpvFRQ0rQyVpWpF6MS4MIrlSrdrXvqduR9SB/SheepLost.jpg&quot; target=&quot;_self&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://api.ning.com:80/files/7gjKKn4oGHRhsvrv9PxgyE5kgdzd47rfUvnXWOhN8sNiAqlWdfY*alJ2SCM6QpvFRQ0rQyVpWpF6MS4MIrlSrdrXvqduR9SB/SheepLost.jpg&quot; width=&quot;664&quot; class=&quot;align-center&quot;  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-5&quot;&gt;Class Engagement Option&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe id=&quot;kaltura_player&quot; name=&quot;kaltura_player&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;402&quot; src=&quot;https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1157612/sp/115761200/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/29018071/partner_id/1157612?iframeembed=true&amp;amp;playerId=kaltura_player&amp;amp;entry_id=0_b3za6al5&amp;amp;flashvars[streamerType]=auto&amp;amp;flashvars[localizationCode]=en&amp;amp;flashvars[leadWithHTML5]=true&amp;amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.plugin]=true&amp;amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.position]=left&amp;amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.clickToClose]=true&amp;amp;flashvars[chapters.plugin]=true&amp;amp;flashvars[chapters.layout]=vertical&amp;amp;flashvars[chapters.thumbnailRotator]=false&amp;amp;flashvars[streamSelector.plugin]=true&amp;amp;flashvars[EmbedPlayer.SpinnerTarget]=videoHolder&amp;amp;flashvars[dualScreen.plugin]=true&amp;amp;&amp;amp;wid=0_p64kkmx6&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;One way is using the new &lt;strong&gt;Class Engagement&lt;/strong&gt; feature located under &lt;strong&gt;My Tools&amp;gt;Classlist&lt;/strong&gt; in your course. This tool is especially useful for the first several weeks of a course in quickly identifying and reaching out to students who havenâ€™t logged in or begun participating in course discussions. The short video below will walk you through with more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-5&quot;&gt;Gradebook Option&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe id=&quot;kaltura_player&quot; name=&quot;kaltura_player&quot; width=&quot;608&quot; height=&quot;402&quot; src=&quot;https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/1157612/sp/115761200/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/29018071/partner_id/1157612?iframeembed=true&amp;amp;playerId=kaltura_player&amp;amp;entry_id=0_p6qjybtt&amp;amp;flashvars[streamerType]=auto&amp;amp;flashvars[localizationCode]=en&amp;amp;flashvars[leadWithHTML5]=true&amp;amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.plugin]=true&amp;amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.position]=left&amp;amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.clickToClose]=true&amp;amp;flashvars[chapters.plugin]=true&amp;amp;flashvars[chapters.layout]=vertical&amp;amp;flashvars[chapters.thumbnailRotator]=false&amp;amp;flashvars[streamSelector.plugin]=true&amp;amp;flashvars[EmbedPlayer.SpinnerTarget]=videoHolder&amp;amp;flashvars[dualScreen.plugin]=true&amp;amp;&amp;amp;wid=0_3gotymwu&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In the first several weeks, it is important to establish classroom management expectations. Doing so helps your students understand better the course and your policies. They will turn in assignments more frequently and on time. Use the gradebook to find students who havenâ€™t turned in assignments by the due date and send them a quick and encouraging reminder email for the first several weeks. The short video below will walk you through this process with more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-5&quot;&gt;Late Adds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Know your dates. Youâ€™ll want to know the&amp;#160;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.byui.edu/student-records/academic-deadlines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Add deadline&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; date for each semester. Why? Well, if a student adds your class a week after it has begun, youâ€™ll want to step in and provide support. This can include a brief communication, by phone, email, discussion board post or instant messenger, that outlines what they need to do to catch up. Youâ€™ll also want to &lt;a href=&quot;http://byu-idaho.screenstepslive.com/s/14177/m/53240/l/497013-how-do-i-release-overall-grades-to-my-students?id=497013-how-do-i-release-overall-grades-to-my-students&quot;&gt;release final grades&lt;/a&gt; for that student, since it wonâ€™t be released along with the others you did earlier. Finally, youâ€™ll want to make sure to &lt;a href=&quot;http://byu-idaho.screenstepslive.com/s/14177/m/53637/l/496507-how-do-i-add-students-to-a-group-or-edit-group-size?id=496507-how-do-i-add-students-to-a-group-or-edit-group-size&quot;&gt;enroll them in any groups&lt;/a&gt; in your course, if your course does not automatically do group enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-5&quot;&gt;Drop Deadline Policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Be aware of the Drop Policy. It is never your duty as an instructor to remove students from your course enrollment on your own. Students who may wish to drop from a class should be referred to the Pathway Support Center for Pathway students and the Online Support Center for BYU-Idaho students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;font-size-5&quot;&gt;Know Your Resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;BYU-Idaho has been blessed with sufficient resources so that we do not have to search for our &quot;Lost Sheep&quot; alone. &amp;#160;We have some great assistance with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pathway.lds.org/help&quot;&gt;Pathway Support Center&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.byui.edu/online/online-support-center&quot;&gt;Online Support Center&lt;/a&gt;, and our &lt;a href=&quot;http://igx.byui.edu/advising/&quot;&gt;Academic &amp;amp; Advising Support Centers&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#160;In addition to technical assistance, you can also refer students to these resources for advising, counseling, and tutoring. If you are not sure where to turn for help, you can utilize these resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If a student decides to stop attending a class, knowing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.byui.edu/student-records/academic-deadlines&quot;&gt;Academic Deadlines&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.byui.edu/student-records/grades/participation&quot;&gt;guidelines for &quot;F&quot; and &quot;UW&quot;&lt;/a&gt; submission is helpful. &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;If you notice that a student is starting to miss assignments or miss an entire week in class, it is important to contact him or her as soon as possible. &amp;#160;Many times, a student will respond positively to a teacher reaching out; students often just need some encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</content>
